Missing Requirment:
A video was requested to visualize this demo. I have been unable to present one at this time due to the fact that for two days the screen cast app kept failing during development which might be due to the long hours and making me start afresh trice.Therefore i decided to continue the development as to meet up the deadline.I implore that if there is need for more scrutiny, i can be called to explain any part of the code base.
